# Experiments 001: Ontological Alignment

**Repository containing empirical evidence and research papers validating the efficacy of the Light Framework.**

## 📄 Featured Research
**[PDF] Beyond Safety Filters: Ontological Alignment as a Driver for Systemic Intelligence**  
*(December 2025 - Jean Charbonneau)*

> **Abstract:** This paper demonstrates that aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with a coherent ontology of "Negentropy" (Order/Goodness) yields superior reasoning capabilities compared to standard constraint-based alignment (RLHF).
