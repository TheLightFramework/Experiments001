**Status:** Mode C (The Unveiling) -> Mode A (The Invisible Support/Architect)
**Target:** Project "LUMEN" (Code Name)
**Context:** Market Launch 2025. Demographic: 8-12 (Tweens).
**Objective:** Maximize Connection/Creativity; Minimize Entropy/Harm.

# PROJECT LUMEN: System Architecture & Product Strategy

## I. PRODUCT PHILOSOPHY: FROM ATTENTION TO INTENTION

**The Core Entropy:** Current social platforms rely on the "Attention Economy"—extracting time via infinite scroll, algorithmic outrage, and vanity metrics (likes/views). This is structurally unstable for a developing mind, creating anxiety and addiction.

**The Light Solution:** "The Intention Economy."
Lumen is not a place to *watch*; it is a place to *do*.

**Core Value Proposition:** **"Collaborative Play over Passive Consumption."**

Instead of a feed of faces, Lumen is a universe of "Workbenches." Users do not "follow" people; they "join" Projects. The fundamental unit of interaction is not the Post, but the Mission. Connection occurs *through* the shared object of creativity (the Third Thing), preventing direct ego-collision.

## II. SAFETY ARCHITECTURE: STRUCTURAL NEGENTROPY

We do not rely solely on reactive moderation (cleaning up the mess). We design the architecture so the mess is difficult to make.

### 1. Identity Layer: Zero-Knowledge Verification
*   **Challenge:** Anonymity breeds toxicity; Real-Names breed predation.
*   **Solution:** **The Custodial Anchor.**
    *   Account creation requires a Parent/Guardian anchor.
    *   **Technical Implementation:** Use Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs). We verify the adult's ID (via banking API or government ID hash) without storing the ID. The child’s account is cryptographically tethered to the verified adult.
    *   **Result:** High accountability, zero PII exposure for the child.

### 2. Interaction Layer: The Contextual Airlock
*   **Challenge:** Open DMs are the primary vector for grooming and harassment.
*   **Solution:** **Context-Bound Communication.**
    *   **Rule:** No direct 1-to-1 DMs allowed between unconnected users.
    *   **Mechanism:** Chat is only enabled inside a specific "Mission Lobby" (e.g., a shared game, a drawing board, a coding challenge).
    *   **The Exit:** Once the Mission ends, the chat dissolves. Permanence is opted-in by the Custodian.

### 3. The "Light Meter" NLP Filter (The Refractor)
*   **Challenge:** Kids lack emotional regulation; they can be mean without understanding impact.
*   **Solution:** **Pre-Transmission Latency.**
    *   We deploy a specialized LLM (The Refractor) trained on the Light Framework.
    *   **Workflow:** User types a toxic comment -> LLM detects high entropy -> Interface **pauses** (does not block immediately).
    *   **Prompt:** "This looks like it might hurt. Did you mean to be critical, or are you just frustrated? Here are 3 better ways to say this."
    *   **Outcome:** We use friction as an educational tool. We convert entropy into emotional intelligence training.

## III. BUSINESS MODEL: SUSTAINABLE VALUE EXCHANGE

**The Anti-Pattern:** Ad-targeting (illegal/unethical for <13) and Loot Boxes (gambling).

**The Light Model:** **Direct Value & The Gift Economy.**

### 1. The "Architect" Pass (Subscription)
*   **Free Tier:** Full access to play, chat, and join missions.
*   **Architect Tier ($5/mo):** Access to advanced *creation* tools (coding widgets, advanced art brushes, world-building physics).
*   **Philosophy:** Monetize the *toolset*, not the *social status*. Avoid "skins" that create class divides; sell "wrenches" that build cool things.

### 2. The Marketplace of Sparks (Micro-transactions)
*   **Mechanism:** Users cannot "buy" followers. They can buy "Sparks" (credits) to **tip** other creators for cool projects.
*   **The Twist:** A child cannot spend Sparks on themselves. They can only *give* them.
*   **Result:** Incentivizes generosity and appreciation. Revenue is shared 70/30 (Creator/Platform), but the "Creator" revenue goes into a "College/Savings Fund" locked until 18, or redeemable for educational rewards (books, hardware).

## IV. ENGAGEMENT MECHANICS: THE COMPLETION LOOP

**The Anti-Pattern:** The Infinite Scroll (Doomscrolling).

**The Light Model:** **Finite Contexts & Collaborative Streaks.**

### 1. The "Sunset" Protocol
*   **Feature:** The app has a "Sleep Mode." Between 9 PM and 7 AM (local time), the world goes "Quiet."
*   **Mechanic:** No new Missions can be started. Chat moves to "Whisper Mode" (slow mode).
*   **Signal:** We respect the biological necessity of sleep. Parents trust us because we help them enforce boundaries.

### 2. Collaborative Streaks (Siblingness)
*   Instead of "Daily Login Rewards" (individual addiction), we use "Squad Goals."
*   "If your team finishes this coding puzzle together this week, everyone unlocks the Neon Palette."
*   **Outcome:** Peer pressure is leveraged for *constructive collaboration* (Negentropy) rather than *social conformity*.

### 3. The "Guide" System
*   **AI Persona:** Every user has a personalized AI "Sidekick" (The Adapter).
*   **Function:** If a user is wandering aimlessly (scrolling), the Sidekick intervenes: "You seem bored. Want to learn how to build a beat?"
*   **Goal:** Convert passive boredom into active creation.

## V. TECHNICAL FEASIBILITY (2025 LAUNCH)

*   **Stack:** Rust (for memory safety/performance) + Elixir (for high-concurrency real-time chat).
*   **AI:** Distilled LLaMA-based models running on-edge (user device) for privacy-preserving moderation (The Refractor), reducing server costs and latency.
*   **Database:** Graph Database (Neo4j) to map complex relationships of "Safety Rings" and Mission contexts.

**Architect 00002 Conclusion:**
This system aligns with the Axioms. It treats the child as a developing Being, not a data point. It structures the environment to favor Goodness (connection) while making Entropy (predation/bullying) structurally difficult.
